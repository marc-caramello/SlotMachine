# SlotMachine  
I got this project from here, and I made a few changes:  
  •https://github.com/hhamzak/SlotMachine  
  
Features that I added:  
  •A high-score feature, which keeps track of your high-score  
  •A save feature, which saves your: total coins, current bet, and high score, even after closing and re-opening the game  
  •A variable called "buttonsAreEnabled", which fixed the error where you can spam the handle multiple times in a row  
  •High-energy background music, which makes the game feel more intense  
  •The "Screen.SetResolution(800, 600, false)" function, which fixed the error where the game would only go into full-screen mode  
  •The Konami logo in the bottom-left, which helps fill in some of white space
